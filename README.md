STORM Dashboard is team 2729's implementation of FRCDashboard. Some changes have been made to the overall structure in an overall attempt to make the dashboard more accessible to newer teams or students that don't know JavaScript/HTML.

## Setup and Build

You'll need [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org) & [`npm`](https://npmjs.com).

Before running your dashboard, you'll need to install the node dependencies by `cd`ing into the dashboard directory and running `npm install`.

### Configuration/Sources

For more information on specific build details, visit the FRCDashboard Github page / repository.
